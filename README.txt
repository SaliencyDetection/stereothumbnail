The implementation code (V1) is for: 
===========================================================================
W. Wang, J. Shen, Y. Yu, and K-L. Ma, 
Stereoscopic thumbnail creation via efficient stereo saliency detection,
IEEE Trans. on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 
in press, doi://10.1109/TVCG.2016.2600594, 2016
===========================================================================

This is a personal reimplementation of the method proposed in above paper. 
Importantly, it was written for clarity of understanding, and is totally unoptimized.
For realistic timing and results to compare against, 
please refer to the material included in the original publication. 

The code is free to use for research purposes. If you use this software for research purposes, 
you should cite above paper in any resulting publication.

The code has been tested on Window and Linux platforms with matlab.
